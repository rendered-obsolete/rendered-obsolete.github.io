<meta name="description" content="This is a draft of a post I composed in March, 2016. Only partially completed, but maybe it will be of some value to someone. &lt;p/&gt; Our backend has been based on Microsoft Orleans (MS Research, GitHub) for some time. We’re primarily running the entire backend- deployment and all- on Windows 7 mostly because: &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s convenient since all developers are running Windows on their desktops&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s easier for QA to test and operate playtests until everything is fully automated and we’ve got devops tools in place&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our company is mostly a “Windows shop” anyway&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; It’s been a long time coming, but we’ve finally gotten around to looking at running the backend on Linux. A few components, namely Zookeeper and MongoDB are fairly straight-forward since they’re arguably intended to run on Linux. That leaves Orleans itself and, of course, our own game server. &lt;p/&gt; Orleans should “in theory” work fine on top of Mono. However, our Orleans projects are a bit of a mess, so I thought I’d just try running the binaries produced by Visual Studio. And shockingly (see “…debug everywhere”), it mostly worked; we only ran into the following problems: &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We use log4net and our App.config was specifying ColoredConsoleAppender which didn’t work on Mono (switched to ConsoleAppender)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We spawn our game servers using Process.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = true and caused an error “xdg-open: unexpected option …” (we set UseShellExecute to false on Linux- Windows seems to require it)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Our config file had a Windows “smell”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It refused to startup with the version of mono that ships with Ubuntu 14.04, but installing the latest, stable version fixed that&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; Next came getting our game server to compile and run on Linux. Luckily, our WAF-based build system should “just work” on Linux (in theory). Most of the compilation and runtime problems fell into just a few categories: &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hard-coded windows specific paths and commands&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paths that were incorrect with a case-sensitive filesystem&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Asserts that were triggered by incomplete implementations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p/&gt; N.B.: At the time of writing we were using CryEngine 5.0. Since then the WAF buildchain has been retired in favor of cmake &lt;p/&gt; Our initial round of deployment scripts where based on PowerShell 3.o and left a lot to be desired. PowerShell 3 (as opposed to 1 or 2) was chosen because it provided disconnected sessions allowing us to execute things on a remote machine and leave them running in the background without leaving a shell connected (or installing as a service). But, PowerShell 3 isn’t installed by default on Windows 7 and then some other stuff is needed on remote machines to get remote commands working at all. Generally speaking, it was the overall idiosyncratic behaviour (Invoke-Command takes PSCredentials but old commands like “net use” don’t- and there’s apparently no modern replacement), and unfamiliar syntax (passing ArgumentList to Invoke-Command’s ScriptBlock) that made the PowerShell prototype take longer than I expected. And there’s still a few things that just don’t work. Granted, I’m a completely new to PowerShell, and like all advanced tools there’s a nontrivial learning curve. PowerShell is without a doubt leaps and bounds better than cmd.exe, and some aspects like getting auto-complete for commands and arguments in the ISE were welcome. &lt;p/&gt; In a completely unfair comparison (given that I have non-trivial Linux experience), we were able to fully automate deployment to Ubuntu in under a day. The frustration of Invoke-Command/Credential/InDisconnectedSession was replaced with the relatively straightforward use of ssh and nohup. And, once you get password-less ssh and sudo setup, and embrace other commands like screen, working with multiple remote machines is a breeze. &lt;p/&gt; All-in-all we were up and running on Ubuntu 14.04, rocking nightly builds in Jenkins, deploying to AWS, and doing playtests within a week. opens a beer" />
