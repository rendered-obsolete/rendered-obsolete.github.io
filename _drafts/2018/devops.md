Last night I was lamenting the abject disappointment that is our "devops transformation".  Where or when had it gone wrong?

## Rewind

Going into the current project, I feel like we have the wind at our backs:

- Prior experience
    - Real-world learnings on two previous projects with more modest aspirations (one involving a very large, legacy codebase)
    - Extensive hands-on with numerous tools of the trade: msbuild, [jenkins](https://jenkins.io/index.html), etc.
- Armed with knowledge
    - [A handbook](https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations/dp/1942788002/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1534477404&sr=8-3)

- Greenfield
    - Mostly new, from-scratch project with minimal "legacy" code (in the pejorative sense)

- Management buy-in
    - Complete with department presentation extolling the virtues of TDD, CI/CD, and a glorious devops vision
    - Designated head-count

## Fast-Forward

- We still lack the necessary culture
    - Tests are 

## Where or When had it Gone Wrong?

Hubris.

But let's not ignore the spectre that is unrealistic expectations.

In truth, it hasn't "gone wrong" much less failed.  It is very much a living, breathing work in progress.  It's the journey, stupid.
