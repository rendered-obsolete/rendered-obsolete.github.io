## My Origin Story

I graduated from the [University of Kansas](https://www.ku.edu/) with a B.S. in Computer Engineering fall 2002- pretty much at the the low-point of the [dotcom bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble).  By 2001 it was already abundantly clear that the good times were over because many of my classmates who had accepted offers were getting severence packages and told to not show up.  I opted to flee the country.

I've spent the last 15 years abroad: 6 in Japan, 9 in China.  Anecdotes abound.

## Lacking a Particular Order

- Unbeaten Highways

    __TL;DR__ Don't assume too much; sometimes nobody pursues the "obvious" route

    To round out my my liberal arts credits I took a semester of Japanese.  I was lamenting the state of the economy to my professor and at her behest I applied for a [Monbukagakusho Scholarship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monbukagakusho_Scholarship).  Now, you'd think that a lot of people would apply for all "all-expenses-paid trip" to Japan.  Turns out that at the time they were handled regionally in the U.S., I was one of only 3 people that applied in the mid-west, and I was the only engineer.

- Beware the "teaching English" trap

    __TL;DR__ It's a trap.  No skills/resume development, minimal networking, etc.

    First company I was involved in the interview process we received an unusual resume; guy studied Computer Science at MIT then spent the last few years working as an English teacher.  None of the hiring managers even wanted to bother with an interview.  Too many years of irrelevant experience completely offset a very expensive education.

- Unbeaten paths

    __TL;DR__ Try small, obscure companies

    A graduate student from Bangladesh wanted to stay and work in Japan.  Had no Japanese language ability, most companies wouldn't even extend him an interview.  But he kept at it and eventually got to some company that almost no Japanese people applied to.  They offered him a job with visa support and payed for him to go to language school because they were desperate to hire someone.
