Now that you're a stranger in a strange land it's time to get on to the good stuff... living.

Because every country has different laws and regulations, companies, and customs I can't possbly cover every situation.  Instead of answers I hope to give you some idea of what you should search for and questions to ask.

Talk to the locals as well as other expats to get tips.

## Post-Move

- Change of address
- Inform the IRS

Retain a permanent address.

## Money

When you first arrive you're probably going to need a fair amount of money because you're going to spend more than you usually do to cover:
- Apartment deposit and/or first month's rent
    - This is likely your biggest initial expense.  If getting this much foreign currency is problematic, consider asking your employer for an advance on your first paycheck.
- Transportation (car, bicycle, scooter)
- Appliances and furniture
- Toiletries and cleaning supplies
- Dishes, cookware, and linens
- Stocking a new kitchen
- And so on...

If you use credit cards (issued in your home country):
- Make sure to notify them you'll be "traveling" or purchases may get declined
- Look out for __foreign transaction fees__.  Many cards charge 1-3% for overseas use.
    - [Capital One](https://www.capitalone.com/) has cards with no fees, [there's others](https://creditcards.usnews.com/no-foreign-transaction-fee).  The [Apple Card](https://www.apple.com/apple-card/) has impeccable timing.

If you use debit/ATM cards (issued in your home country):
- Again, maybe foreign transaction fees but ATM fees are more likely.
- Personally, I wouldn't use my debit card overseas.  Wait until you get a local bank account and stick with on-hand cash/credit until then.

Consider looking into an alternative account to use:
- [List of cards](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/banking/debit-card-foreign-transaction-international-atm-fees/) with and without fees.
- [Charles Schwab "High Yield Investor Checking Account"](https://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/banking_lending/checking_account) is awesome because they will waive _or reimburse_ any fees while abroad.  I made the mistake of using an overseas address and they told me I was ineligible and declined my application...
- Nowadays there's several alternatives to traditional banks- "mobile banks" like [N26](https://n26.com)

Long-term you'll need to transfer money back (and maybe forth).  There's always the traditional route of using your bank or a third party like [Western Union](https://www.westernunion.com).  There's a bunch of alternatives:
- [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/)
- [TransferWise](https://transferwise.com/)
- [MoneyGram](https://www.moneygram.com)
- [Xoom](https://www.xoom.com)


## Your First Day

Bring gifts

## When in Rome...

I've seen some people that fall into an "expat" life-style and never really leave their comfort zone.  It's really a lost opportunity, and if you're going to do that you could have just stayed home.

- Learn the language: real-time translation is right around the corner.  But, even in countries with high English proficiency I've found it interesting and rewarding to learn the local language.
    - See if your company will provide or reimburse language lessons.
    - [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) is fun
- Regional activities: some hobbies are more feasible some places than others.  For example, I've been thrilled about very accessible scuba diving in Cyprus.
- Dating: some of my best and some of my hardest relationships were abroad.

## Live Lean

I debated calling this "pre-emptive tidy", but the point is to avoid accumulating stuff that you'll have to deal with later.

- Look for a furnished apartment: not available in all markets outside of often prohibitively expensive "serviced apartments", but avoid buying larger furniture
- Eat out: the more you eat out the easier it is to keep a sparse kitchen
- Go digital: I don't buy physical books simply because of how annoying and expensive they can be to move
- Quality: buy fewer but better things.
- Mobility: don't buy a desktop PC, laptops only.

### Keep a Journal

I've kept a journal on and off since I was in high school, but I wish I'd been more consistent with it.  I couldn't tell you the number of things "I'll never forget", and no longer remember.

I like to hand-write things in a notebook- feels more personal.  When I visit home at the end of the year I put any filled notebooks into storage and have a pretty good-sized stash now.  A few years ago I flipped through one from when I was in college and almost didn't recognize myself.  It's fascinating.  Just do it, I suspect you'll be really glad 30 years from now.

## Flights Home

Invariably you'll want to make flights back.

Most of the litany of loyalty programs I find annoying and pointless.  However, I'm a big proponent of sticking with more or less the same airline and trying to rack up points.

If you do any amount of business travel as well, you can really rack them up.  Even if someone else does the booking, many airlines will allow you to retroactively get a credit.

The points by themselves are worthwhile since you can redeem them for flights, hotel rooms, and car rentals.  But you can advance to higher levels/tiers in the loyalty program: "silver", "gold", whateter.

The perks depend on the airline, route, and your level, but may include:
- Seat upgrades: usually extra leg-room and on some airlines you even get a _slightly_ wider seat or other perks.
- Lounge access: when waiting for a connection after a 10+ hour flight sometimes it's nice to be somewhere with quiet, better wifi, more outlets, nicer chairs and bathrooms, and food and drink (including booze).
- Luggage allowance: depending on the airline and route you get extra checked bags and/or increased weight limits.
- More points: gain points faster at higher levels.

Depending on the route there may be one clear airline to invest in.  If you'll be flying between major hubs and there's a wide choice of airlines it's still worth thinking about.  If I had to choose between saving $200 on another airline versus getting the miles to level-up with my usual carrier, I'd pick the latter.

## Frequent Traveling

If you fly into the U.S. frequently and are elligible, take a look at [Global Entry](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/global-entry).  Besides breezing through U.S. immigration, it automatically enrolls you in [TSA PreCheck](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/global-entry/tsa-precheck).

## Conclusion

Patience and a good attitude.
