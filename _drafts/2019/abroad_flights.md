Each of the last 15 years I've flown somewhere between 15,000 and 70,000 miles every year.  I'm still far from million-miler status with any airline, but I have learned a few things.


## Pre-Flight Prep

### Route Selection

Look for a route with a long-ish layover (6+ hours) midway.  Few things lessen the strain of travel like cutting it in half and spending the night in an airport hotel.

### Seat Selection

Most airlines let you pick your seat either at booking, or within 24 hours before departure.  Do it.

- Aisle

An aisle seat generates leaves you with the most horizontal space and gives you freedom to go to the restroom or get up and stretch.
I'm right-handed so I prefer the aisle on my right side as that will give me full mobility of my dominant hand.

If you've got a carry-on under the seat in front of you it can be a bit awkward to rummage through it.  It's often easier to slide it into the aisle to rescue some item from the bottom.

If it includes a movable armrest for wheelchair accessibility it can be raised by pressing a button or lever either on the underside or back of the armrest.  This lets you slip out of your seat without having to put your tray up or trying to juggle drink/laptop/food-tray/etc.

- Maximize Leg room

Emergency exits are always good.  But I like bulkheads- the first row after business/first or bathrooms/gally- even more:  
- Ample leg space
- Prop your legs up against the bulkhead (depends on your height)
- Often won't have cart or foot traffic going past you throughout the flight

I've seen people that bring folding/inflatable foot-stools on board.  They deserve a tip-o-the-hat for being travel savvy.  A sturdy piece of luggage works just as well.

Otherwise, look for complimentary upgrades to the "premium" or economy "plus" or whatever they call it.

- Window

Some people swear by the window seat as it gives you the best option for leaning up against something to sleep.  Personally, I don't subscribe to this school of thought, but it may be a key consideration for you.

### Meal Preference

Most airline meals aren't as bad as the stereotypes would have you believe.  But, sometimes: they run out of your first choice, or the meat is dubious at best.  At one point I started requesting the vegetarian/vegan meal and decided that it was better than the regular meal on average.

### Power

For longer flights your battery operated devices might not be able to make it.  USB ports for power are increasingly common, so keep charging cables in your carry-on.

There's frequently power outlets between seats.  They're often too loose to support the weight of a Mac power adapter, so either use a cable so you can set the adapter on the floor or invest in one of the [lighter GaN adapters](https://www.anker.com/products/variant/powerport-atom-pd-1-[gan-technology]/A2017111).

Depending on where you're flying to/from and the carrier you may also need a plug adapter.

Depending on the devices in your entourage, consider investing in a power bank- especially one that supports [USB Power Delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_hardware#PD).  [Anker](https://www.anker.com/products/variant/powercore-speed-20000-pd/B1275011) among others make batteries capable of powering my laptop, my [Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/switch/), or my phone.  The [FAA limits batteries to 100 Wh](https://www.faa.gov/hazmat/packsafe/more_info/?hazmat=7) so even the larger 26,800 mAh batteries fly (26800 mAh * 3.6V / 1000 = 96.48 Wh).

### Seat Cushion

On older planes and budget airlines the seats don't seem to be designed for comfort.  If you're slender or lacking in posterior your butt can really suffer on flights.  And then there's the dreaded "swamp butt".  I won't go into details, but modern synthetic materials seem to have been chosen to be easy to clean rather than maximizing air flow.  Consider looking into a portable cushion like the [Purple Everywhere](https://www.amazon.com/Purple-Everywhere-Seat-Cushion-Relieving/dp/B01CKMP2Z8).

### Noise-Canceling Headphones

Contrary to what the name implies, noise-canceling won't make the flight silent, but it will be quieter.  More importantly, you'll be able to listen to music, watch TV/movies, and play games at a sane volume without blaring over the background drone.  
Now ubiquitous in airports, both the Bose QC35 and Sony WH-1000XM have sufficient battery life and are comfortable for long periods, albeit pricey.

If you wear glasses, the case also makes a nice place to stash them while you sleep.

### Sleep Aids

Neck cushions, eye masks, auxillary bedding, etc.  I don't like carrying extra, bulky stuff and rarely sleep anyway, so I don't have strong opinions about this stuff.

### Meds

Sleep aids.

Dramamine for motion sickness.

You're going to be in closed spaces with at least one sick person.  Consider getting your flu shot and taking an immune system booster.  Do they actually work?  No idea.  But preventative measures are cheap and easy.

### Packing

I never fly without aspirin.  If you're prone to headaches and often need Tylenol, or have a back/shoulders that flare up and need ibuprofen, bring it.  Nothing is worse than having to sit through the flight in discomfort.

If you quickly get hangry or are prone to blood sugar swings like me, bring snacks.  You can always ask the airline staff for something, but I'd rather have a protein bar than whatever they have to offer.

It's dry, I always bring chapstick, eye drops, and a bottle of water as well.

Bring toiletries, a change of undergarments, and other necessities in your carry-on.  If your luggage gets misplaced you won't be terribly inconvenienced.


### Wardrobe

It goes without saying to dress for comfort.  I also like to bring a pair of slippers to change into and put my "proper" shoes in the overhead compartment.  Another option is to grab a pair of disposable slippers provided by some hotels.

### Frequent Traveling

If you fly into the U.S. frequently and are eligible, take a look at [Global Entry](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/global-entry).  Besides breezing through U.S. immigration, it automatically enrolls you in [TSA PreCheck](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/global-entry/tsa-precheck)- which is handy even for domestic travel.



## Before Take-Off

I like to walk around airports.  I'm not a big duty free shopper or anything.  I just don't understand the appeal of sitting in waiting area right before a 10+ hour flight.  
- Buy gifts for friends/co-workers/partners
- Pick up a bottle of water and some snacks

### Booze

Airport lounges and international flights generally serve free booze.  If you like to partake, keep in mind it's a diuretic and generally means more bathroom trips as well as dehydration.

### Nicotine

If, like several of my co-workers, you smoke/vape.  Some airports have convenient smoking lounges, others require you to exit security or are just unpleasant.  Regardless, you can't smoke anywhere on planes.  There's gum and lozenges that can help you avoid flipping out at 5,000 feet.

The vapes with juice reservoirs, like fountain pens, are prone to leak with the pressure changes.  If it's in your pocket you're going to absorb the nicotine through your skin and end up with nicotine poisoning.  I've heard this is really unpleasant.

In the weeks leading up to your flight, taper down.

I'm not a smoker so there's likely lots more tips/tricks.  Consider taking the opportunity to quit.

## Other

Keep your stuff together.  Resist the urge to place stuff in the seat pocket in front of you.  When the time comes to de-plane if you're been awake for 36 hours or barely slept you'll be pretty insane.
