I was having trouble getting some code to work and after fooling around a bit had the "no-rtti" compiler flag brought to my attention.<br /><br />no typeid()<br />no dynamic_cast<> <- resulted in program crash for me<br /><br />This can make the STL's unexpected handling of polymorphic types that much more difficult to deal with.
