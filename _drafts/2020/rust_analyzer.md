[2019 State of Rust Survey](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/12/03/survey-launch.html) got me thinking.  I use [RLS](https://github.com/rust-lang/rls) when programming Rust, and it's ok but I don't really like it.  It works, but it's so slow that it doesn't feel like it makes you more productive, and I don't think it aides development as much as it could.
