For our [current project](http://dev.playruyi.com/) we've been making heavy use of [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), both in the forums as well as [developer documentation](https://bitbucket.org/playruyi/docs).  I've been finding it so painless that it got me thinking about an overhaul of [my blog](https://rendered-obsolete.blogspot.com/).

I've always found [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com/) a bit... tedious.  I just wanted to write simple posts and not have to fiddle with HTML/CSS too much.  But I was using [another site](http://codeformatter.blogspot.com/) to include code snippets.  Then there was the browser-based text editor.  And having to use a VPN to access it from within China meant I usually couldn't be asked to bother with it at all.

In writing our documentation I started to really appreciate the model supported by [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) (and [Github](https://github.com/)).  A search turned up [this post](https://int3ractive.com/2015/09/goodbye-blogger-hello-github-pages.html) that got me thinking a migration to markdown was within reach.  Namely, composing the blog posts in markdown then converting everything to a static website with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## Installing Jekyll on OSX

Naturally, things on OSX take a bit more work.  I already had ruby installed, so setting up Jekyll:

1. Follow [Jekyll installation instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).  Additionally:
    - Install autoconf/automake/libtool ([instructions](http://munchpress.com/installing-autoconf-automake-libtool-on-mac-osx-mountain-lion/))
    - From [Jekyll troubleshooting for OSX](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/troubleshooting/#installation-problems):
    ```
    xcode-select --install
    sudo gem install -n /usr/local/bin jekyll
    ```
1. `sudo gem install jekyll-import` to [install jekyll-import](https://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
1. Follow the [Blogger import instructions](http://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/blogger/)

## Editing

I've become a big fan of writing markdown with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/markdown).

As mentioned in [Working with drafts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/drafts/) you need to start Jekyll with `jekyll serve --drafts` to pickup items in the `_drafts/` folder.

Open a browser to `localhost:4000` to preview the site.

## Publishing to BitBucket

`jekyll build` will output the website to `_site/`.

Bitbucket provides pretty clear [instructions]((https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/publishing-a-website-on-bitbucket-cloud-221449776.html)) for setting up a static website.

I ended up with a directory structure similar to:
```
|____ .git/
|____ src/
| |____ jekyll/
| |____ _posts/
| |____ _drafts/
| |____ _site/
| |____ _config.yml
| |____ Gemfile
|____ index.html
```

This allows me to keep the markdown and generated static site in the same repository.  Copying the contents of `_site/` to the root of the repository and using `git push` to publish to Bitbucket.

And with that I bring you [https://rendered-obsolete.bitbucket.io/](https://rendered-obsolete.bitbucket.io/)!
