Despite my whining in the last post I got things mostly setup the way I wanted.  Switched out to starting with simpler, shorter template, and made all my changes offline in vi.  Only took another iteration or two to actually get everything working.<br /><br />It's not quite perfect, but it's close.  Let's say 85%.  Good enough that I'm going to use it until we get closer to, say... 95%.  Need to make sure it isn't actually hard to read or something else equally <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">dysfunctional</span>.<br /><br />Despite my artistic handicap, I even managed to come up with a logo and matching <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">favicon</span>.  Go me!
