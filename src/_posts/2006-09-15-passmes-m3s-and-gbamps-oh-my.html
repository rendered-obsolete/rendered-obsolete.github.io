Odds are, if you've been interested in running <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">homebrew</span> code on the Nintendo <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">DS</span>, you were probably more than a little lost/confused initially (if you ever got it figured out).  There *is* an active community out there, but most of the information is spread out across different bulletin boards, in different threads, often containing more than a little incorrect and/or outdated information, and using terminology/abbreviations you're probably not yet familiar with.  Maybe I'm just the kind of person that really likes to have a good grasp of what I'm doing and what all my options are rather than running with "just do X" as posted by some_random_guy023.<br /><br />Far and away the best write up I've come across is the <a href="http://www.dslinux.org/wiki/Running_Homebrew">Running <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">Homebrew</span></a> wiki entry at <a href="http://www.dslinux.org/"><span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">DSLinux</span></a>.  It does a nice job of presenting the various requirements and what your options are, the between them such as in which circumstances you can use them and what the pros/cons are, as well as providing links (via <a href="http://wiki.pocketheaven.com"><span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">Pocketheaven</span></a>) to specific products/<span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">manufacturers</span>.<br /><br />Check it out and save yourself a lot of headache/irritation.
