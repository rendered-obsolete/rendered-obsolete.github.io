Should the first post of a blog about console development/game development/general programming  have any other title?<br /><br />I should think not.<br /><br />Partially inspired by my "extra-curricular" interests as of late, my long-standing love for <a href="http://www.mixi.jp"><span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">Mixi</span></a> (a Japanese social networking site), and partially driven by news of <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>'s intent to update the extremely outdated and ghetto Blogger, we have a new blog.  Hopefully it won't befall the same fate as <a href="http://jeikabu.blogspot.com/">my last ill-conceived and neglected blog</a>.<br /><br />My hope is that interest in one will help drive and sustain progress/motivation in the other.<br /><br />I intend to try and keep this reasonably focused on the area of console development.  Logically, it will on occasion expand into other areas such as general game development and programming.<br /><br />I'll be looking into the templates, <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">CSS</span>, etc. in short order to try and make it look a little less generic.
