It looks like I jumped the gun a bit in <a href="http://rendered-obsolete.blogspot.com/2006/08/hmmm-api-has-changed-eh.html">yesterday's post</a> when I complained about the ease of learning to use DevKitPro (DKP).<br /><br />Got some sleep and woke up a lot less grumpy today so I thought I'd give it another shot.  This time with a clear head.<br /><br />I came across the <a href="http://www.patatersoft.info/manual.html">PataterSoft tutorial</a> and in the process of messing around with it I ended up going back through the "examples" directory of DKP.  And, I must say.... they're really well commented, fully explained, easily understood examples.  Maybe that's why all the tutorials have fallen into states of disrepair; they're unneeded.  You just pick the directory you want and learn about what's in there- it's kind of like "Choose Your Own Adventure".<br /><br />Really didn't take much to get a few easy examples going.  I retract all the nasty things I said earlier and instead tip my hat in their general direction.
