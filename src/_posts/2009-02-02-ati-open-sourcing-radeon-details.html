I have a lot of respect and admiration for the lengths that ATI goes to to release information to the public.  Last year they made the <a href="http://www.x.org/docs/AMD/r600isa.pdf">Radeon 6xx series ISA</a> available.  In the last couple of weeks they've released <a href="http://www.x.org/docs/AMD/R6xx_3D_Registers.pdf">details on 3D registers in the 6xx/7xx series</a>, and the (albeit primitive but not simple) <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/r600_demo/">r600_demo</a> (via git from <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org">freedesktop.org</a>).  The availability of this kind of information is a huge boon to hobbyists, researchers, developers, and pretty much everyone else that cares.<div><br /></div><div>I've given all the above resources a look through and I hope to spend a bit more time pouring over the r600_demo (not for the faint of heart or API-dependent).  Thus far I've only had access to documents related to NVidia hardware from the previous generation (under NDA).  The differences are seemingly non-trivial but I'm not certain if it's a result of genealogical advances or manufacturer architectural differences.</div>
