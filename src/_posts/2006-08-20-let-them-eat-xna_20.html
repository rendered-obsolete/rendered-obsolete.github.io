Although hardly news anymore, Microsoft's <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/aug06/08-13xnagamestudiopr.mspx">annoucement of a free XNA Game Studio Express</a> is well worth mentioning.  At launch it will only allow for Windows development in C# with the XNA Framework (R.I.P. Managed DirectX), but they will eventually include support to build games for the Xbox 360.<br /><br />How cool is that?<br /><br />Granted, you have to join the XNA Creator's Club with a "value-added" price of $99 per year to develop *OR* even play someone else's games (via <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx/xna/faq/">FAQ</a>).  But, that's still quite a bit cheaper and with less red tape than an <a href="http://www.warioworld.com/apply/wii.html">official Wii developer's kit</a> (hint: $2,500-$10,000).<br /><br />Beta begins Aug. 30.
