Long live “Rendered Obsolete”!!!!On the topic of blog content/maintenance/etc., we should be seeing a new design here shortly. There really isn’t much to the Blogger templates, now I’m just busy mucking around with CSS. I’m a bit old-skool when it comes to web-design; I haven’t done much since the heyday of HTML 2.0… yeah… I remember being all impressed when I got RealAudio meta-files figured out (are they even still around?). Anyway, stay tuned for that.Also, in order to placate my insatiable whims for name changes, yet still amuse myself, I’ve decided to use a “sub-title” of sorts for the blog. Just something I can change from time to time, yet is essentially meaningless. What does this mean for you? Absolutely nothing. But, please think of it as being +1 to the “amusement” factor of the blog. Unexpected. Spontaneous. Random." />
