This is easily confirmed if you check the dylib source; it just uses libc to call dlopen and kin. That means that rather than using prepend_search_path to ensure the dynamic library can be found, you can set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the output path of dynamiclib (e.g. $HOME/dynamiclib/target/release). Allowing you to build and run the executable with: &lt;pre&gt;LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/dynamiclib/target/release crate run&lt;/pre&gt; I&#39;m admittedly a little bit disappointed that dynamic libraries are so painfully close to native interop preventing idiomatic implementations that transparently work like native code. Something a bit more like the magic in .Net- but that would bring the runtime nastiness that rust tries so hard to avoid. &lt;p/&gt; It&#39;s worth noting that if you have no intention of re-loading the dynamic library and you simply want to link with it, I could have changed dynamic/src/main.rs to: &lt;pre&gt;#[link(name=&quot;dynamiclib&quot;)]extern { fn test() -&gt; u32;}fn main() { println!(&quot;Got: {}&quot;, unsafe { test() });}&lt;/pre&gt; Now dynamiclib needs to be in one of the locations that rust searches for libraries (e.g. dynamic/target/debug) at build time." />

    Was wanting to figure out how to do a rust dynamic library because I've been thinking about how I could apply software updates to a running system.  I came across <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/dynamic_lib/struct.DynamicLibrary.html">dynamic_lib</a> which is apparently deprecated and replaced with <a href="https://crates.io/crates/dylib">dylib</a> (with the same <a href="https://tomaka.github.io/glium/dylib/struct.DynamicLibrary.html">api</a>), but there's still fairly little documentation.  Pretty much the only simple working example I was able to find was <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26688575/manually-call-a-rust-dynamic-library">this StackOverflow question</a>.  But it's from over a year ago and predates even rust 1.0 (I'm currently using 1.7).  <p/> To start off, use <a href="http://doc.crates.io/guide.html">cargo</a> to setup two projects; one for the library itself, another for the executable that uses it:  <pre><br />cargo new dynamiclib<br />cargo new --bin dynamic<br />cd dynamiclib<br /></pre> Add the following to dynamiclib's Cargo.toml: <pre><br />[lib]<br />crate-type = ["dylib"]<br /></pre> Setting the crate-type to "dylib" means a dynamic library will be built (rather than an executable or static library).
