Occasionally (often?) no attempt is made to embrace a sensible workflow or sanely design/organise the UI. But, even when MVC or some other established design pattern is attempted it usually fails. &lt;p/&gt; More often than not it’s due to lack of really understanding the model, developers taking shortcuts to “save time” (this is really a production failure), or a disconnect with the pattern in the heat of implementation. But, I think a framework or environment (i.e. lack of process) that permits such transgressions is just as much to blame. &lt;p/&gt; One of the things that initially attracted me to Xamarin was the ability to develop multi-platform native apps in a language we were already using for other things- C#. Additionally, via Xamarin Forms their embrace of MVVM (wikipedia) similar to WPF.

Spurned by this post I decided this was a good opportunity to investigate ways of translating design requirements into concrete implementation using Xamarin’s framework targeting MVVM.

I want to reference some of the various other sources I’ve looked at, how and why I was trying to compose things, and the problems I ran into. For reference, this is all in the context of a companion app prototype I’m writing for our in-development PC/XboxOne MMOFPS.
