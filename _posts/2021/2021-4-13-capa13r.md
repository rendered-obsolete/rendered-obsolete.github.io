Between my love of game consoles and working on [Z+ with AMD]({% post_url /2018/2018-10-15-zplus-microservices %}) I perhaps have an unhealthy obsession with AMD APUs.  When AxiomTek announced ([1](https://www.techradar.com/news/raspberry-pi-not-powerful-enough-for-you-this-compact-board-boasts-an-amd-ryzen-apu), [2](https://techbriefly.com/2020/05/20/the-more-powerful-raspberry-pi-alternative-carries-an-amd-ryzen-apu/)) a single-board-computer with Zen CPU cores and Vega graphics I was... intrigued, and thought it might make for a nice [Steam Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_Machine_(hardware_platform)).

## Hardware

Details on the CAPA13R board are available from the [product page](https://www.axiomtek.com/Default.aspx?MenuId=Products&FunctionId=ProductView&ItemId=25592&C=CAPA13R) and more detailed [spec sheet](https://www.axiomtek.com/Download/Spec/en-US/capa13r.pdf).  Common features:

- AMD Ryzen Embedded V1605B or V1807B APU
- DDR4 SO-DIMM (up to 16GB of memory)
- 1 x M.2 Key B (for SSD), 1 x M.2 Key E
- 2 x 10/100/1000 Mbps Ethernet
- 2 x USB 3.2 Gen2
- 2 x HDMI, 1 x [DisplayPort++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort#DisplayPort_dual-mode_(DP++)), 1 x [LVDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-voltage_differential_signaling)

Notably, it lacks wifi and bluetooth.  The wifi I can do without (the board requires external power so an ethernet cable is fine), but I added a USB bluetooth adapter I had laying around.

| | V1605B | V1807B
|-|-|-
| Memory | DDR4-2400 | DDR4-3200
| Power min. RMS (W) | 12V @ 2.5A | 12V @ 4.2A

Details on the AMD SoC are available from the [Ryzen Embedded V1000 series](https://www.amd.com/en/products/embedded-ryzen-v1000-series) product page and 
the [product brief](https://www.amd.com/system/files/documents/v1000-family-product-brief.pdf).  All models have 4 cores (8 threads, 4M L2 cache) [Zen micro-architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_(first_generation_microarchitecture)) CPU married with a Radeon Vega 8 GPU ([GCN5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Core_Next#Graphics_Core_Next_5)):

| | V1605B | V1807B
|-|-|-
| CPU base/max GHz | 2.0 / 3.6 | 3.35 / 3.8
| GPU [CU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Core_Next#Compute_units)/GHz/TFLOPS | 8 / 1.1 / 1.1 | 11 / 1.3 / 1.8
| [TDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_design_power) range/nominal (W) | 12-25 / 15 | 35-54 / 45
| DDR4 (MT/s / GB/s) | 2400 / 19.2 | 3200 / 25.6

Like [NVidia's Jetson Nano]({% post_url /2019/2019-04-01-jetson_nano %}), the memory bandwidth is rather low.  For comparison, the [original Xbox One/Xbox One S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One#Hardware_comparison) has 8 Jaguar cores (pre-Zen, 8 threads), 12 CUs ([GCN2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Core_Next#Graphics_Core_Next_2), 1.3/1.4 TFLOPS), and DDR3 at 68.3 GB/s.  It's difficult to make an "apples to apples" comparison because Zen has 52% improved IPC, GCN 2 and 5 are fairly distant, and the Xbox has an additional 32 MB of ESRAM at 200+ GB/s (generally used for render targets).  But, the V1605V and V1807B are "in the ballpark" of the original Xbox and Xbox S, respectively- memory bandwidth aside.

I picked up a lower-end CAPA13R with the V1605B and added:

- Transcend 240GB SATA III 6Gb / s MTS420S 42mm M.2 SSD
- HyperX Impact DDR4 16GB, 2666MHz CL15 SODIMM XMP - HX426S15IB2 / 16
- PicoPSU-60 12V DC-DC ATX Mini-ITX 0-60W power supply power
- Salcar 60 W Transformer Power Adapter (12 V 6 A, 5.5x2.5mm)

To secure M.2 devices use "m3" screws (3mm in diameter).  The screw holes go all the way through the board so you can use any length, but 8mm is sufficient.

Until [ATX12VO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATX#ATX12VO) (also see [this guide](https://www.gamersnexus.net/guides/3568-intel-atx-12vo-spec-explained-what-manufacturers-think)) becomes more of a thing, I'm using a 60W PicoPSU with pins 13 and 14 (OR pin 14- `PS-ON`- to one of the other GNDs) shorted to power the system.  Depending on your power supply of choice, another approach may be necessary.

It's worth mentioning __SSW1__, the small switch to the far left of the external ports.  With 1-2 closed (switch _away_ from the external ports) auto power on is disabled and the soft power button is needed to power on the system.  With 2-3 closed (switch _towards_ external ports) power on is enabled and just plugging the system in will auto power on.

Power button.  Non-latching ("momentary") push-button.

## Benchmarks

Installed Windows 10 20H2/19042.631 and the [drivers](https://www.axiomtek.com/Default.aspx?MenuId=Products&FunctionId=ProductView&ItemId=25592&C=CAPA13R&upcat=270) to get audio and graphics working.  Otherwise stuck with the stock install and ran a few benchmarks:

Benchmark | Settings | Score Min/Avg/Max FPS
-|-|-
Unigine: Heaven 4.0 | 4K/OpenGL | 45 1.1 1.8 4.0
Unigine: Heaven 4.0 | 1920x1200/OpenGL | 252 4.5 10.0 24.1
Unigine: Heaven 4.0 | 1080p/OpenGL | 317 5.1 12.6 35.1
Unigine: Superposition v1.1 | 1080p med/OpenGL | 857 5.72 6.41 7.89
Unigine: Valley 1.0 | 1920x1200/DX11 | 596 9.7 14.2 24.1

Benchmark | Settings | Score Graphics CPU
-|-|-
3DMark Demo Time Spy v1.2 | 4K/64-bit | 595 529 2085
3DMark Demo Time Spy v1.2 | 1920x1200/64-bit | 641 571 2170

So, not cut out for 4K gaming.  However, during none of the benchmarks did the heatsink even become warm, and even the 1080p performance isn't very good.  I wondered if either the PicoPSU or power adapter just wasn't delivering enough power, but the GPU seemed to be fully engaged:

![](/assets/capa13r_task_manager_gpu.png)

What stands out is the GPU has only 1 GB of dedicated memory.  This was a limiting factor for us with the [Z+ console](https://github.com/subor/sdk/blob/master/docs/topics/optimization.md) (which had a carve-out of 2 GB for dedicated graphics memory leaving 6 GB of system memory).  In our case, we had a BIOS option to specify the amount reserved for VRAM, but the CAPA13R BIOS currently has no such option.

In hind-sight I probably should have gone with the V1807V since the GPU is ~60% more powerful.

_Update 2021/4/22_:

Received a new BIOS from Axiomtek with a 3GB carve-out for dedicated GPU memory (see [Updating BIOS](#updating-bios)).  I re-ran some of the benchmarks and there was no meaningful change...

This coincides with the [general consensus](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/7mw7pn) that increasing the amount of dedicated memory doesn't improve performance because the GPU accesses memory through the same unified bus as the CPU (UMA) and shared memory allocated by the driver/OS has the same performance.

But why did Z+ show a performance difference?  I believe there's a few key differences:

1. Z+ had significantly less memory; 8 GB vs 16 GB here.
1. Z+ had [256 GB/s GDDR5](https://github.com/subor/sdk/blob/master/docs/topics/hardware.md) memory and a non-SSD drive, so the difference between memory and disc bandwidth was huge.
1. "Rise of the Tomb Raider" and "Shadow of Mordor" in-game benchmarks use a lot more system/graphics memory than any of these benchmarks; in the screenshot above 35% of 16 GB total memory with 1.0/1.5 GB of dedicated/shared memory.

When the benchmark exceeds the amount of available memory things start getting paged out to disk.  Perhaps the OS/driver version Z+ had made poor choices and increasing the amount of dedicated memory kept GPU allocations in memory.  Similarly, when we increased the carve-out to 3 GB, that only left around 4 GB which put too much pressure on system memory and we also saw a perf drop.  When there's plenty of memory, this doesn't happen, or the current OS/driver just does a better job.

## Software

The default boot prompt timeout is 1s, so you'll have to be quick to change BIOS settings.  Press `esc`, set __Advanced > Smart Fan Function__ to __Enabled__.  This allows the fan speed to adjust based on the SoC temperature and makes the system much quieter.

Optionally, set __Boot > Quiet Boot__ to __Enabled__ to suppress the BIOS startup screen.  However this replaces the Windows 10 logo with the American Megatrends logo- which doesn't look great.  Changing the UEFI logo seems to require a tool like "HackBGRT", but I decided to not bother because the boot prompt timeout is short enough that my TV often isn't even on when the BIOS startup is displayed.

Have Steam auto-start in [Big Picture Mode](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php), via __Steam > Settings__:

- Under __Library__, __Low Performance Mode__ and __Disable Community Content__

Configure [users to auto-login](https://superuser.com/questions/1623508):

1. Change registry:
    1. Enter `Win+R` and type `regedit` OR hit `Win` key and start typing `registry editor`, then hit `enter`
    1. Browse to __HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\PasswordLess\Device__ change __DevicePasswordLessBuildVersion__ to `0`
1. Enter `Win+R` and type `netplwiz`, then hit `enter` OR click __OK__
1. Uncheck __Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer__ and click __OK__

Now when you restart the system it should login and launch straight into Steam BPM:

![](/assets/steam_bpm.png)

With an added USB bluetooth adapter, pair with a Dualshock 4 controller (or your preferred gamepad):

1. In Windows __Settings > Bluetooth & other devices__
1. __Add Bluetooth or other device > Bluetooth__
1. On DS4 press SHARE and PS/home button at the same time and hold until controller LED starts flashing
1. Should appear as "Wireless Controller", click it to pair

To only see games with _full_ gamepad support:

1. Steam __Library__
1. Move to the far right to find __Filter Games__ and check __Controller Supported__

Games often use resolutions outside the narrow capabilities of TVs.  To maximize support:
- Enable __Start > Radeon Settings > Display > GPU Scaling__
- Try individual games' display modes; "windowed", "fullscreen", etc.
- Set TV to "game" or "PC" mode (may also improve input latency)

In the end, perhaps 40% of the games I tried either didn't display correctly, or only displayed correctly at 4K but ran at an unacceptable framerate.

Optional but useful, there's a number of wireless keyboards with integrated touchpad on the market:

To invert the two-finger scroll gesture, try using registry editor to change `ScrollDirection` in `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\PrecisionTouchPad`.  If that doesn't work, try setting `FlipFlopWheel` as per [this answer](https://superuser.com/questions/948348).

To enable/disable edge gestures, use `EnableEdgy` in `PrecisionTouchPad` registry, or follow [this forum post](https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/48507-enable-disable-edge-swipe-screen-windows-10-a.html).

## Updating BIOS

To update the BIOS you need to boot into an EFI shell.  Some of the [standard ways](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/boot-to-uefi-mode-or-legacy-bios-mode) to do this:

- Enter BIOS setup and __Save & Exit > UEFI: Built-in EFI Shell__
- Windows 10 reboot into EFI shell
    1. Click virtual power button, hold `shift` and __Restart__.  Or, __Settings > Update & Security > Recovery > Restart now__.
    1. __Troubleshoot > Advanced options > UEFI Firmware Settings__
- Bootable USB device
    1. FAT32 format USB device
    1. Copy [EDK2 X64 shell.efi](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/UDK2018/ShellBinPkg/UefiShell/X64/Shell.efi) to `d:\efi\boot\BOOTX64.efi` (replace `d:` with USB drive)
    1. Enter BIOS setup, __Boot > Boot Option #1 > UEFI: Your USB device, Partition 1__, then save changes and exit.

Should reboot into an EFI shell, and you can flash the BIOS:

```sh
# Change to USB device
Shell> fs0:
# Run flash script
FS0:> flash.nsh
```

You can use various commands like `cd`, `ls`/`dir`, and `exit` to change directories, list contents, and exit the EFI shell, respectively.  If you open `flash.nsh` you can see it does something similar to:
```
AfuEfix64.efi CAPA13RXB.001 /p /b /n /reboot
```

## Next Steps

Need to find some kind of case.  Haven't decided if I'll try to buy or 3D print one.

Haven't been able to get it waking from USB.  I've tried disabling "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" and enabling "Allow this device to wake the computer" for everything related to USB and HID devices in Device Manager, as well as disabling "USB selective suspend" in advanced Power Settings.  In the BIOS the only options for __Advanced > ACPI Settings > ACPI Sleep State__ are "Suspend Disabled" and ["S3"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/power/system-power-states), but there doesn't seem to be anything related to USB wake.

Maybe I'll look into running some other software like [RetroArch](https://www.retroarch.com/), or [Kodi](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc) (formerly XBMC) later.

Most importantly, play some games!
