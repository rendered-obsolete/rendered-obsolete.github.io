The <a href="http://www.insomniacgames.com/tech/techpage.php">Insomniac Tech (R&amp;D) Page</a> is a great source for PS3/performance/game-programming related information.  Even if you happen to not like their games or subscribe to their approach to SPU programming (by choice or otherwise), they've got a lot of resources related to different aspects of engine and game development.  And since they are a game studio all the information is very "practical".  I applaud their openness and willing to share information online, at GDC, etc.<div><br /><div>Their <a href="http://www.insomniacgames.com/tech/articles/0907/spu_instruction_cheat_sheet.php">SPU Instruction Cheat Sheet</a> has a permanent home on my desktop.</div><div><br /></div></div>
