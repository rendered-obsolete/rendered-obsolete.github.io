[Raspberry Pi 4 w/ 8GB RAM](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/8gb-raspberry-pi-4-on-sale-now-at-75/)- latest iteration of the venerable Raspberry Pi.  Version 4 with 8 GB RAM and 64-bit Raspbian OS to leverage all that sweet, sweet RAM.  Assuming it has the [USB-C fix](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/07/raspberry-pi-4-uses-incorrect-usb-c-design-wont-work-with-some-chargers/), seems like now is the time to splurge.

[AMD APU w/ Vega graphics](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/axiomtek-capa13r-amd-ryzen-radeon-vega-raspberry-pi)- we previously worked with an [AMD APU utilizing Zen CPUs and Vega graphics]({% post_url /2018/2018-10-15-zplus-microservices %}) and I've longed for a similarly equipped SBC.  Looks like one is finally here.  With eyes on the upcoming PS5/Xbox Series X, one could assume that an even more powerful version is on the horizon.

[Nvidia Jetson Xavier NX](https://www.anandtech.com/show/15799/nvidia-announces-jetson-xavier-nx-developer-kit-for-399)- we [lamented the memory bandwidth of the Jetson Nano]({% post_url /2019/2019-04-01-jetson_nano %}) and this iteration brings it up to par with the TX2- albeit at a much higher price-point.

[Google Coral Dev Board Mini](https://coral.ai/products/dev-board-mini)- the Coral line of products targeted at ML applications has a number of interesting products available now, but I'm eagerly anticipating this standalone board.

[AWS Graviton2](https://www.anandtech.com/show/15578/cloud-clash-amazon-graviton2-arm-against-intel-and-amd)- ok, not exactly embedded hardware, but I have a penchant for non-x86 compatible hardware. The $/W numbers are enticing and should encourage platforms that can target alternative architectures.
