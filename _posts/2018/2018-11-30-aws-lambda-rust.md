Among [the AWS Lambda announcements](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-for-aws-lambda-use-any-programming-language-and-share-common-components/) is a feature called "Lambda Runtime API" to enable use of different programming languages.

This is accompanied with the immediate availability of a [Rust Runtime](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/rust-runtime-for-aws-lambda/)!

There's been a lot of "serverless", "Wasm", and other web-technology buzz-words flying around (as always), and my stance is usually _wait and see_.  But this is very tempting and may be the nudge I've been waiting for- I __do__ like AWS.
