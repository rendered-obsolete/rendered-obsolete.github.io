Well, I knew it was bound to happen...<br /><br />I went ahead and created the blog and decided on a name, and then I thought of a name I'd rather have the very next day.  I figure, with the blog still in its infancy there's no harm in changing it at this point.  So...<br /><br />R.I.P. "Rendered Useless".  Long live "Rendered Obsolete"!!!!<br /><br />On the topic of blog content/maintenance/etc., we should be seeing a new design here shortly.  There really isn't much to the Blogger templates, now I'm just busy mucking around with <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">CSS</span>.  I'm a bit old-<span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">skool</span> when it comes to web-design; I haven't done much since the heyday of HTML 2.0... yeah...  I remember being all impressed when I got <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">RealAudio</span> meta-files figured out (are they even still around?).  Anyway, stay tuned for that.<br /><br />Also, in order to placate my insatiable whims for name changes, yet still amuse myself, I've decided to use a "sub-title" of sorts for the blog.  Just something I can change from time to time, yet is essentially meaningless.  What does this mean for you?  Absolutely nothing.  But, please think of it as being +1 to the "amusement" factor of the blog.  Unexpected.  Spontaneous.  Random.
