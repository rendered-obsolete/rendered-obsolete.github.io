You would have to try hard to avoid hearing about WebAssembly/WASM.  Hardly a day goes by without another article popping up.

Some years ago we used [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) to turn a C/C++ game engine into JavaScript/WebGL for running in a web browser.  Amusing, but the resulting mess was big, slow, and pretty painful to debug.  [Unity dialed this to 11](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/05/06/an-introduction-to-ilcpp-internals): `C# -> (via Mono) IL -> (via IL2CPP) C++ -> (via emscripten) JavaScript`.  They deserve a tip o' the hat for that impressive bit of sofware engineering gymnastics, but I'm glad I never had to use it.

I've been curious about the tech behind WASM, but not being a web-frontend guy was only casually/passively interested.  WASI changes that by embracing WASM outside the browser; another contender for the ["write once, run anywhere"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once,_run_anywhere) panacea.

_The Rust Connection_.  Namely, why Rust?  The Rust team made [WASM a focus for 2018](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/03/12/roadmap.html#four-target-domains) because 
[reasons](https://mgattozzi.com/rust-wasm/).  The crux of the argument being:  

1. Languages without runtimes are the best candidates for WASM (i.e. C/C++/Rust)
1. Rust is better/safer/easier (especially for people coming from JavaScript) than C/C++

Perhaps subjective, but palatable with the right colored glasses (unless you're a diehard C/C++ enthusiast).  Are Rust and WASM the solution to all your problems?  Probably not, but we can be interested in the tech regardless.

Rather than write a verbose treatise on WASM basics (of which there are many), thought I'd round up various resources and notes/browser tabs I've got hanging around.

- Runtimes: [wasmtime](https://github.com/CraneStation/wasmtime/), [Lucet](https://github.com/fastly/lucet), and [wasmer](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer) (all built with [cranelift](https://github.com/CraneStation/cranelift)).  [cervus](https://github.com/cervus-v/cervus) Linux user-mode.
