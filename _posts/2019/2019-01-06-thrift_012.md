Since using [protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) on a former project I've developed a love (obsession?) for serialization libraries.  On our [current project](https://github.com/subor/sdk) we use [Apache Thrift](https://github.com/apache/thrift) which we're in the process of updating to the recently released 0.12.

## Apache Thrift

One lesson learned from using protobuf was we wasted a lot of effort on the messaging layer: identification (multiplexing different message types over a single channel), framing, error handling, connection management, etc.  [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) was still in its infancy so we looked at options that provided a more complete solution including a transport abstraction.  We settled on [Apache Thrift](https://github.com/apache/thrift).

I've already written extensively about Thrift ([0]({% post_url /2018/2018-08-24-aspnetcore-thrift %})
[1]({% post_url /2018/2018-08-30-rust-thrift %})

[4]({% post_url /2018/2018-11-22-thrift-forwarder %})), so I'll close with some notes I had laying around about building it on OSX.

### 0.11

As is often the case, doing things on macOS takes a touch more effort.  
Mostly followed directions from [https://thrift.apache.org/docs/install/os_x](https://thrift.apache.org/docs/install/os_x):

- boost 1.67

      ./bootstrap.sh
      sudo ./b2 threading=multi address-model=64 variant=release stage install

- Both openssl 1.0.2o and 1.1.0h built but libevent ended up with linker errors
- libevent 2.1.8 (without encryption)
    
      ./configure --disable-openssl --prefix=/usr/local && make -j4 && sudo make install

- bison 3.0.4

      # Could not get compiling on OSX 10.13.4
      ./configure && make -j4 && sudo make install
      # Instead install via brew
      brew install bison
      export PATH=/usr/local/opt/bison/bin:$PATH

- thrift 0.11

      ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-boost=/usr/local --with-libevent=/usr/local
      make -j4 && sudo make install

### 0.12

After just over a year without updates, [Thrift 0.12](https://github.com/apache/thrift/releases) was finally released at the tail-end of 2018.  Dependencies are the same as with 0.11, but ran into some issues.

`make` failed with:
```
libtool: compile:  g++ -std=c++11 -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I../.. -I../../lib/cpp/src/thrift -I../../lib/c_glib/src/thrift -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/include -I./src -D__STDC_FORMAT_MACROS -D__STDC_LIMIT_MACROS -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -g -O2 -MT src/thrift/transport/TSocket.lo -MD -MP -MF src/thrift/transport/.deps/TSocket.Tpo -c src/thrift/transport/TSocket.cpp  -fno-common -DPIC -o src/thrift/transport/.libs/TSocket.o
src/thrift/transport/TSocket.cpp:173:15: error: out-of-line definition of
      'hasPendingDataToRead' does not match any declaration in
      'apache::thrift::transport::TSocket'
bool TSocket::hasPendingDataToRead() {
              ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
src/thrift/transport/TSocket.cpp:179:3: error: unknown type name

      'FIONREAD'
  int r = THRIFT_IOCTL_SOCKET(socket_, FIONREAD, &numBytesAvailable);
```

Turns out it was picking up 0.11 header files that had been installed to `/usr/local/include/thrift/` and had to delete those.

Next, failed with:
```
Making all in test
composer install --working-dir=../../..
make[4]: composer: No such file or directory
make[4]: *** [deps] Error 1
```

"Composer" seems to be some php thing it's looking for despite running configure using `--without-php` and `--without-php_extension`.  We didn't investigate this, but it can be avoided by not building the tests:`./configure --disable-tests`.

## Pain Points

### Unions

The `netcore` generator was released as part of 0.11 but the `union` option generated code that didn't compile.  This was fixed in 0.12:
```thrift
struct PlayMsg{
      1: string url,
}
union RequestMsg{
      1: PlayMsg Play,
      // 2: OtherMsg Other,
      //...
}
```

An abridged version of the generated code:
```csharp
public abstract partial class RequestMsg : TAbstractBase {

      public abstract object Data { get; }

      public class Play : RequestMsg {
            private PlayMsg _data;
            public override object Data { get { return _data; } }
            public Play(PlayMsg data) : base(true) {
                  this._data = data;
            }
```

When used, it is a perfect fit for [pattern matching](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/pattern-matching) introduced with C# 7:
```csharp
// RequestMsg message = ...
switch (message)
{
case RequestMsg.Play msg:
    // Need a cast here T_T
    PlayMsg play = (PlayMsg)msg.Data;
```

Note the cast to `PlayMsg` because the property is `object Data`.  This kind of nonsense has no place in a strongly-typed universe!  Luckily, [it's a bug](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-4715) that will hopefully get fixed in 0.12.1 without having to wait for 0.13.

### Nuget

The Thrift team is back to publishing a [package to nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ApacheThrift/).  It contains .NET 3.5, 4.5, and Standard 2.0 libraries.  [As I wrote before]({% post_url /2018/2018-11-27-nupkg-ergonomics %}#when-to-not-multi-target), we have a problem where our .NET Framework 4.6.1 projects automatically reference the 4.5 library while we want to use the Standard library (in Thrift they're modestly different).

We're on the fence about reporting this "issue".  Feels more particular to our use case and not generally applicable.  Perhaps it should be a [`<PackageReference>`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files) feature.  In the meantime we're publishing [our own package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Subor.Thrift.NETCore/) (but pointing people to the official package).
