That day has come.

There's been a Raspberry Pi 3 B with a touchscreen [running Windows 10 IoT Core]({% post_url /2018/2018-09-02-win10-iot-core-raspi %}) on my desk at work for a while now.

We've been using [docker and Qemu to test aarch64/ARM64]({% post_url /2019/2019-02-06-docker-qemu %}), but [.NET Core for ARM32 doesn't work atop Qemu](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/6298).  So we need an actual device running Debian.  It just so happens I have another Pi 3!

## Install Rasbian

The official installation instructions are good:
1. [Download Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/)
1. [Install](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md)

For example, on macOS:
```bash
diskutil list
# Note my SD card reader is /dev/disk2

diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2
sudo dd bs=1m if=~/Downloads/2018-11-13-raspbian-stretch.img of=/dev/rdisk2 conv=sync
sudo diskutil eject /dev/rdisk2
```

## SSH and VNC
Pretty much the first thing I ever do is get SSH working so I can use a single keyboard/mouse/screen/etc.  While you're there you can turn on VNC:
```
sudo raspi-config
```

- _Interfacing Options > SSH > Yes_
- _Interfacing Options > VNC > Yes_

When it comes to Linux configuration, one of the best investments you can make is setting up "SSH Key-Based Authentication".  If that means nothing to you, look into it, it will change your life.  There's numerous excellent guides on the internet, but if you're on Linux/macOS you should be able to:
```bash
# Replace with IP address of your Pi
ssh-copy-id pi@192.168.X.Y
# From now on you can ssh in without a password
ssh pi@192.168.X.Y
```

Speaking of investments, given the premium placed on screen real-estate don't overlook the `-X` option to ssh (on macOS/OSX you also need [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/)):

VNC will give you access to the full desktop (alternatively, look into xrdp).

If you use a VNC client other than RealVNC you may not be able to connect.  TigerVNC complains: `No matching security types`.  Either use RealVNC or follow the [VNC configuration instructions](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/vnc/).

## Screen

If you've got some kind of small display (like the [7" touchscreen](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-touch-display/)) you may need additional configuration.

- Rotate screen 180 degrees.  In `/boot/config.txt` add:
    ```
    lcd_rotate=2
    ```
- Adjust screen brightness (max brightness is `255`, higher than that results in "I/O Error"):
    ```
    sudo sh -c "echo 80 > /sys/class/backlight/rpi_backlight/brightness"
    ```
- Virtual Keyboard.  Regardless if you call it a "soft keyboard", "on-screen keyboard", or something else, you might want one.  Regardless if you prefer iOS or Android, prepare to be disappointed:
    ```
    sudo apt-get install matchbox-keyboard
    ```

## Software

Update the firmware (may not be necessary with recent devices):
```
sudo rpi-update
```

For case-insensitive shell auto-completion, in `~/.inputrc`:
```
set completion-ignore-case on
```

Pretty much the first thing you're going to want to do is:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y vim screen # Other stuff...
```

If you haven't already, take the time to learn vim or emacs.  Nano/pico are the Linux moral equivalent of Windows Notepad.  It takes a month to feel productive, but totally worth it.  If you go with emacs and have a gimpy ctrl key (like Mac laptops), you might want to swap "caps lock" and ctrl:
- MacOS: __System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard > Modifier Keys...__
- Win10: in PowerShell ([from this SO](https://superuser.com/questions/949385/map-capslock-to-control-in-windows-10)- [you are using PowerShell, right?]({% post_url /2019/2019-03-15-powershell %})):
```powershell
$hexified = "00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,02,00,00,00,1d,00,3a,00,00,00,00,00".Split(',') | % { "0x$_"}
$kbLayout = 'HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout'
New-ItemProperty -Path $kbLayout -Name "Scancode Map" -PropertyType Binary -Value ([byte[]]$hexified)
```

Because everything takes longer on low-end devices, "screen" is handy if you plan to leave the Pi plugged in somewhere and use a laptop.  It allows you to have a session persist after you clam up:
```bash
screen # Start a session
screen -S <name> # Start session with <name>
# Ctrl-a d # Detach from the session
screen -x # Attach to running session
screen -r <name> # Attach to session with <name>
screen -dRR # Attach to session creating/detaching as needed (if multiple use first)
screen -ls # List sessions
screen -e xy # Change command character
# For example, since Ctrl-a interferes with bash's default emacs mode:
screen -e^gg
# Now `Ctrl-g d` detaches and `Ctrl-g g` is a literal `Ctrl-g`
```
